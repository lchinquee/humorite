# Day Scheduler Challenge

## Challenge Description
This challenge, assigned by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, required the creation of an online daily planner. The goal of this activity was to create a user interface that would allow a user to save tasks for specified times of the day and allow the user to edit those tasks. The planner would inform the user, via color coding, if saved tasks were in the past, present or future.
